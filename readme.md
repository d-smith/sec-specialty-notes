# Notes: AWS Certified Security - Specialty

This repo contains notes I wrote while preparing for the AWS Certified Security - Specialty exam. These notes may or may no be useful - I prepared using an A Cloud Guru course that was produced when the exam was in beta. From what I understand, the exam was in beta, then was shortly withdrawn after release, reworked, then offered again.

Most of the material in these notes were jotted down while watching the course videos, while watching various [reinvent videos](https://reinventvideos.com/#), or copied from AWS documentation. In general I've tried to note the sources, but may have missed some acknowledgements.

You may find it useful take a look at my [post exam impressions](./post-exam-impressions.md) to help formulate your study strategy.
